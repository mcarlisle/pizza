Tangle.js practice (FINALLY, AFTER 8 YEARS)

Idea:

Tangle document which creates two sides: 
m pizzas with radius r and crust width s
vs
n pizzas with radius R and crust width S
which has more (non-crust) "pizza"?

That's all.

To do: it draws:
- how many pizzas on each side, 
- their sizes,
- colors the crust (as "non-pizza")
- computes the area of both sides
- assigns which is the "winner" with more "pizza area"
- if different, says which is the "winner" WITH crust counted.
